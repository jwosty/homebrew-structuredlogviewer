# Structuredlogviewer - Homebrew Tap

This repo contains a [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask)
which can be used to install [MSBuild
StructuredLogViewer](https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/MSBuildStructuredLog).

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install --cask jwosty/structuredlogviewer/structuredlogviewer`

Or `brew tap jwosty/structuredlogviewer` and then `brew install --cask jwosty/structuredlogviewer/structuredlogviewer`.

You will have to right-click the app and select "Open" the first time you run it
because it is not signed (see:
https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/MSBuildStructuredLog/issues/686). This is also
the reason it is not yet in the official Homebrew Cask repository.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
